# Udacity-Data-Analysis-Professional---Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data
This is my solution for bikeshare data project - part of Udacity data analysis professional program.

The project aims to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States: 
Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

The project uses Python, NumPy, and pandas to import, convert, and filter the data. Then display trip durations, used stations, and user stats.
